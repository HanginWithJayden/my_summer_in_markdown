# my_summer_in_markdown
My name is Jayden Haynes. I am currently as of now in 10th grade. I am an autistic african-american male, and I want to be a chef when I grow up. I want to attend the Culinary Institute of America and open a diner in the Southeast.

An activtity I participated in (if you can even call it an activity) was attend summer school to complete my P.E creditentials so I have more time to finish the rest of them during the rest of the school year. All I did was do physical activity for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. It was really time consuming.

# my_summer_in_markdown
My name is Jayden Haynes. I am currently as of now in 10th grade. I am an autistic african-american male, and I want to be a chef when I grow up. I want to attend the Culinary Institute of America and open a diner in the Southeast.

An activtity I participated in (if you can even call it an activity) was attend summer school to complete my P.E creditentials so I have more time to finish the rest of them during the rest of the school year. All I did was do physical activity for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. It was really time consuming.

My favorite book series is Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I have all 18 (soon to be 19). I even collected all of the special editions, spin-offs, you think it, I have it. I really like the series mostly because my Tete showed me the series and encouraged me to continue my ambitions before she passed. It meaans a lot to me, even if most think it's not real literature.

A new skill I've learned and have been getting into a lot lately is drawing and animating. Seeing animations of fights, stories, and so much more on the internet inspired me to make my own. It's an original idea of animating I have, so I won't get into detail, but I think once I get better, it'll be legendary.

A sport I engaged over the summer is golf. I think golf is a very interesting sport, but I don't want to go pro though, cooking is my passion. I first got interested in golf from a video game I bought. Completed all the save files and figured out that golf was a sport that's good for me. I then participated in my school's golf club. On rare occasions I go to TopGolf and do some fun practicing. I'm telling you, golf's underrated.
